This repo contains backup code for my Cloud Software Development Assignment 1. The actual assignment was deployed to an AWS S3 bucket.
This site consists of a main page and two redirect files. 

index.html meets the following requirements:
  - The main page is named index.html and it serves as the site's home page. 
  - Hosted on your own cloud platform account: AWS S3
  - At least two separate pages which can be accessed via links on the page: redirectfile.html and redirectfile2.html in the table
  - At least one page must display an image hosted on the cloud platform: transparentfrog.png is on s3 and linked at the bottom
  - At least one page must contain your name, a brief (paragraph) biography, and the phrase "Created for my SWE 4633 class":
    Header has "Created for my SWE 4633 class" phrase and name. "About me" has a biography paragraph as well as other things.

redirectfile.html does the following:
  - This is the first redirect HTML file. It is about my dog.

  - It also demonstrates other HTML and CSS skills such as headers, using images, CSS styling, etc.

redirectfile2.html does the following:
